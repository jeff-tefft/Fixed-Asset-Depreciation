# Fixed-Asset-Depreciation
Fixed Asset Depreciation and Month-End Handler

This excel workbook has a VBA macro that allows an accountant to add, remove, and edit fixed assets, which are then kept up to date in a "Details" sheet. It also allows for easy calculation of the monthly journal entry and for easy reconciliation to QuickBooks. Each of these functions is conveniently located on the appropriately labled worksheet.
